    <h3>Work History</h3>

    <h4>Software Developer, MagiQ Software, Napier, New Zealand</h4>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspJan 2019 - Present<br>
    <p>
      Throughout this job, I learned how to develop software in a professional environment. I put my university training as a
      software developer to the test, learned new languages and gained a more in depth understanding of computing systems from
      a software perspective. This job mainly consisted of projects requiring integration of third party apps, product
      development and bug fixing. The software is a modular based enterprise system covering a broad areas such as financing,
      regulatory systems and reporting. This required me to learn about a wide range of topics relevant to our main clients
      of local councils.
    </p>

    <h4>Technical Support and Sales, NOW NZ, Napier, New Zealand</h4>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMay 2018 - Dec 2019<br>
    <p>
      This was my starting point in the IT industry after graduating from university. I worked as technical support, answering
      phone calls and helping customers with their phone and internet issues. NOWâ€™s main point of difference is the customer
      service provided, so it was extremely advantageous for a technically minded person such as myself to be customer facing
      and talk people through issues. I gained knowledge and experience in delivery of internet and phone lines along with
      basic troubleshooting of network connection issues.
    </p>
    
    <h4>IT Helpdesk Student, Pan Pac Forest Products Ltd., Napier, New Zealand</h4>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNov 2015 - Feb 2016<br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspJun 2016 - Jul 2016<br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNov 2016 - Feb 2017<br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspJul 2017 - Aug 2017<br>
    <p>
      In this job, I worked on training documentation for a new version of a system that was being introduced, and assisted
      the IT staff in various small projects. My role developed into becoming a member of the helpdesk team and problem
      solving for users at the company. I learned how an IT department is run in an industrial environment and what skills are
      important to keep it running efficiently, such as communication and organisation.
    </p>

    <h4>Laboratory Assistant, Higgins Contractors HB Laboratory, Napier, New Zealand</h4>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDecember 2014 - February 2015<br>
    <p>
      I started this job as part of a voluntary program run by Hastings District Council to get school students out into the
      workforce to gain experience in the workplace. I was then offered a full time position over the 2014/15 holiday period.
      I learned the basic scientific method behind simple tests in the road construction industry, as well as the significance
      of health & safety in the workplace.

    <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
    <p>
      I have primarily developed in object-oriented languages, but have taken an interest in scripting styles such as ruby
      after learning them in a professional environment. I have touched on a variety of other languages and concepts briefly
      in different university courses and projects.
